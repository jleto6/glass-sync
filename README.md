# Meta GlassSync

GlassSync is a Meta Glasses integration tool that automates syncing and downloading videos sent through Messenger from Meta View.

It automates media retrieval by logging into a dedicated Messenger account, monitoring a specified chat thread with your main Facebook account (linked to your Meta Glasses), and downloading incoming media automatically.

GlassSync leverages browser automation within Messenger‚Äôs standard web interface, simulating user actions transparently and ethically.

## How It Works

Your Meta Glasses are linked to your **main Facebook account**.  
You create a separate **dedicated Messenger account** (e.g., `ProjectName`) and add your main account as a friend.

When you say:

**"Hey Meta, send a video to ProjectName."**  
Your Glasses transmit the video via Messenger.  
GlassSync automatically detects and downloads the media as it arrives.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/meta-glasses-messenger-sync.git
cd meta-glasses-messenger-sync
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash

```

3. Create a `.env` file in the project root with your credentials:

```bash
MESSENGER_EMAIL=your_dedicated_account_email
MESSENGER_PASSWORD=your_dedicated_account_password
MESSENGER_TARGET_ID=facebook_user_id_of_your_main_account
```

- **MESSENGER_EMAIL** and **MESSENGER_PASSWORD** are credentials for your dedicated Messenger account.
